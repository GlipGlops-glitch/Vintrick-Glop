    Vintrace V6 API

    The vintrace API aims to make integrating vintrace into your application, quick and easy. Each vintrace customer has a different base API URL. If you are setting up an integration with vintrace,  please contact support@vintrace.com with the customer name you are integrating with and we can supply you with the connection URL. Requests should include **Accept: application/json** ## Pagination The vintrace REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in a JSON object with paging metadata. For example: ``` json {     \"firstResult\" : 0,     \"maxResult\" : 20,     \"totalResultCount\": 200,     \"nextURLPath\": \"/mob/api/v/endpoint-path?firstResult=20&maxResult=20\",     \"prevURLPath\": null,     \"results\": [         { /* result 0 */ },         { /* result 1 */ },         { /* result 2 */ }     ] } ``` * **firstResult**: The index of the first item returned in the page. * **maxResult**: The maximum number of items that a page can return. Some operations might have a limit for the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice.    To find the maximum number of items that an operation could return, set maxResult to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of maxResult is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.  * **totalResultCount**: The total number of items contained in all pages. * **nextURLPath**: The API path that will return the next page of data. If not included, this is the last page of data. * **prevURLPath**: The API path that will return the previous page of data. If not included, this is the first page of data. Sample request: `https://demo.vinx2.net/mob/api/v/products/list?firstResult=10&maxResult=20` If **firstResult** is not included in the request it will be defaulted to **0** If **maxResult** is not included in the request it will be defaulted to **20**. Please note that some legacy endpoints have a different default for maxResult which can be found in the endpoint's documentation. ---  # noqa: E501
